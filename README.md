# Netwila Coding Challenge - FullStack Developer

## Challenge

Weâ€™re going to build a very simple authentication function which most applications have. 

### Requirements

* Use node.js to build an authentication API with JWT and another API which requires authentication token to access. Feel free to choose any framework in your favorites. 
* Using React.js to create simple login form with email & password.

### Bonus (highly encouraged)

* Use Redux for state management at client
* Source code should be in well organized structure (Both FE & BE)
* No lint errors found in source code

Once you finish this challenge please push it to GitHub and send back your work to us. 

Thanks for your chance to amaze us with your talent.!
